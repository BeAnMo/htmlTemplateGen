# htmlTemplateGen
A Python script that generates a basic web page.

It works on Linux currently (Xubuntu Core 16.04 for the curious), but I haven't had the time/ability to test on Mac/Win.

Usage:<br/>
&emsp;The script creates a new directory with a single html, css, & js file. It allows the user to specify the
path and directory name, as well as the individual file names. The css and js files are linked into the &lt;head&gt;
of the html, and the javascript runs once the 'window' is loaded.
